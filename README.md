# Fundamentals of Data Analysis-Assessment
by Megan Tully

This repository contains 5 notebooks with exercises for 5 topics, Information,Randomness,Bias,Outliers and Cleansing. It also contains a project notebook called Normal Distribution and lastly this README file with some information on the repository.

This repository was created for my assessment in Fundamentals of Data Analysis. 
## How to run these jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)
1. Download the main jupyter notebook files from this repository and any csv data to your local machine.
2. Open up your command line, I used CMDer which can be found [here](https://cmder.app/).
3. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the above files.
4. Type "jupyter notebook" into the terminal and it should open up jupyter notebook in your browser with these files in it.

<b>Note</b>: You need to have jupyter notebook installed on your machine. I have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) downloaded which contains jupyter notebook. You also need a recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your local machine.

You can also use [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) code to run this file by opening the folder containing the downloaded files inside the application.

### Required Packages (linked to user guides):
1. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide) 
2. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html)
3. [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/)
4. [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
5. [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/index.html)

## Exercises
The notebooks containing the exercises show tasks completed throughout the course that are based on the concepts we had to explore and understand about the topics we covered.


## Project Summary
The notebook that contains the project on normal distribution defines and explains the main concepts associated with the normal distribution.The aim of this project was to provide a step by step insight into some of the concepts of the normal distribution in a way in which it could be presented and understood by my fellow classmates. Some of the concepts we looked at were the empirical rule, standard normal distribution, CDF, PDF, central limit theorem and confidence intervals. These concepts were broken down and explained through the use of plots, images, examples and explanations.
